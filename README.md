I Got inspiration from the movie [" Inception "](https://images.app.goo.gl/Swnh3Qr76KTiFvzF7)

![It's my inspiration - Movie "Inception"](assets/Inspiration-Inception.jpeg)

I want to break the image into cubes, and arrange them on separate layers within a larger box. The overall concept is similar to the movie 'Inception,' where each layer has different elements but can be collapsed into a single space. When the user's mouse zooms in, they see small squares of different images, and when they zoom out, they see the whole image, similar to a Rubik's Cube. This design is useful for the assignment because it incorporates user input and allows users to control their perspective with the mouse. Additionally, we can use a random seed to vary the number of cubes, meeting the assignment requirements.
